            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Emsella is an FDA-cleared, non-invasive pelvic floor therapy that uses High-Intensity Focused Electromagnetic (HIFEM) energy to trigger deep pelvic floor muscle contractions. You sit fully clothed in a specialized chair for 28 minutes per session. The electromagnetic field penetrates clothing and tissue to stimulate pelvic floor muscles directly — producing approximately 11,200 contractions per session. This level of muscle activation far exceeds what voluntary Kegel exercises can achieve, rebuilding the muscle strength and coordination needed to reduce or eliminate urinary leakage."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The standard protocol is 6 sessions over 3 weeks — two sessions per week. Most patients begin noticing improvement around sessions 3-4. Results continue to improve for 4-6 weeks after completing the full series as muscles continue to strengthen. Some patients with more severe incontinence benefit from additional sessions. Maintenance sessions every 6-12 months help preserve long-term results."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Most patients describe a series of tingling, pulsing sensations or a feeling of intense muscle tightening in the pelvic region. It is not painful — more unusual than uncomfortable. You may feel involuntary muscle contractions and some vibration. Intensity can typically be adjusted. You remain fully clothed throughout, seated in a chair that resembles a standard office chair. Most people read, use their phone, or simply relax during the 28-minute session."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Most patients notice a meaningful reduction in leakage frequency and volume after sessions 3-4. The full benefit typically peaks 4-6 weeks after completing all 6 sessions. Clinical studies show 95% of patients report significant improvement in quality of life. For many patients, incontinence resolves completely; others see a major reduction that allows them to return to activities they had been avoiding."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Results typically last 6-12 months after completing the initial 6-session series. Most patients choose periodic maintenance sessions — typically 1-2 sessions every 6-12 months — to preserve their results. Factors like additional pregnancies, significant weight gain, or hormonal changes such as menopause can affect how long results hold."

            "text": "Emsella is not currently covered by Medicare or most private insurance plans and is classified as an elective treatment. Many patients pay with HSA or FSA funds, which are typically accepted. At Bay View Chiropractic in Milwaukee, the full 6-session Emsella package is $1,800."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Emsella works well for most adults experiencing urinary incontinence — both men and women. Ideal candidates include: women with stress incontinence (leaking with coughing, sneezing, or exercise), women with urge or mixed incontinence, postpartum women whose incontinence has not resolved, men experiencing incontinence after prostate surgery, and menopausal women dealing with bladder changes. Emsella is not appropriate for patients with pacemakers, metal implants in the treatment area, or active urinary tract infections."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes. Emsella is effective for men, particularly those experiencing incontinence following prostate surgery (radical prostatectomy). Studies show 70-80% of men regain complete or near-complete continence within 6 months of surgery, and Emsella can accelerate and improve this recovery. Men sit on the chair fully clothed, just as women do."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Emsella is non-invasive with a very favorable safety profile. The most common side effect is temporary muscle soreness, similar to what you'd feel after an intense workout — this typically resolves within 24-48 hours. Some patients notice increased urinary frequency for the first day or two as muscles adapt. There is no downtime; patients return to normal activities immediately after each session."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The main types are: Stress incontinence — leaking with physical pressure like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise, caused by a weakened pelvic floor or sphincter. Urge incontinence — a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by leaking, caused by an overactive bladder. Mixed incontinence — a combination of both stress and urge, very common. Overflow incontinence — inability to fully empty the bladder, causing dribbling, more common in men. Functional incontinence — physical or cognitive impairments that prevent reaching the bathroom in time."

          "@type": "Question",
          "name": "Is incontinence a normal part of aging?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Incontinence becomes more common with age, but it is not inevitable or untreatable. The changes that come with aging — reduced muscle mass, hormonal shifts, prostate changes in men — increase risk. But common does not mean permanent. Most people of any age can achieve significant improvement with appropriate treatment."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Studies show that up to 70% of people perform Kegel exercises incorrectly — contracting the wrong muscles, bearing down instead of lifting up, or doing too few repetitions. Even when done correctly, Kegels require 100-200 contractions daily for 3-6 months to show results. Additionally, Kegels are not effective for urge incontinence, and their effectiveness is reduced in women with low estrogen levels. If Kegels have not worked, it usually means you need a more powerful strengthening approach, not just more Kegels."

          "name": "Can urinary incontinence be cured?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "For many people, yes. Stress incontinence is often significantly improved or resolved with pelvic floor strengthening through Emsella or pelvic floor physical therapy. Postpartum incontinence frequently resolves completely, especially with treatment. Post-prostatectomy incontinence: most men (70-80%) regain near-complete continence with time and therapy. Menopausal incontinence is very responsive to treatment, though ongoing maintenance may be needed given the permanent hormonal change. Severe or structural incontinence may require surgery, but non-surgical options should be tried first."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Stress incontinence leaks happen in response to physical pressure — coughing, sneezing, laughing, jumping, or lifting. The problem is structural: the pelvic floor or sphincter cannot resist sudden pressure spikes. Urge incontinence involves a sudden, overwhelming need to urinate that is hard to suppress, sometimes resulting in leakage before reaching the bathroom. The problem is bladder behavior: the bladder contracts involuntarily or signals urgency when it is not actually full. Many people have both types simultaneously, which is called mixed incontinence."
          }
        },
        {
          "@type": "Question",
          "name": "Does menopause cause incontinence?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes. Estrogen receptors are found throughout the bladder, urethra, and pelvic floor. When estrogen declines during menopause, these tissues thin, lose elasticity, and weaken — directly affecting the ability to control urination. Unlike postpartum incontinence, which may improve on its own, menopausal incontinence typically does not resolve without treatment because the underlying hormonal change is permanent."

        {
          "@type": "Question",
          "name": "Will incontinence go away after pregnancy on its own?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Often, yes — especially with active pelvic floor work. About 30-50% of women experience incontinence in the months following childbirth, but the majority see significant improvement within 6-12 months postpartum. Women who do targeted therapy such as Emsella or pelvic floor physical therapy recover faster and more completely than those who wait passively."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Both target the pelvic floor but through different mechanisms. Pelvic floor physical therapy uses biofeedback, manual therapy, and guided exercises with a trained therapist — effective, but requires 6-12 weekly appointments, daily homework of 20-45 minutes, and significant financial commitment with limited insurance coverage. Emsella requires no active participation — you sit for 28 minutes while the technology does the work, producing 11,200 contractions per session versus the few hundred achievable through manual exercise. Many patients choose Emsella because it is faster, requires less time commitment, and produces results for people who cannot perform voluntary exercises correctly."

            <details>
                <summary>What is Emsella and how does it work?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Emsella is an FDA-cleared, non-invasive pelvic floor therapy that uses High-Intensity Focused Electromagnetic (HIFEM) energy to trigger deep pelvic floor muscle contractions. You sit fully clothed in a specialized chair for 28 minutes per session.</p>
                    <p>The electromagnetic field penetrates clothing and tissue to stimulate the pelvic floor muscles directly — producing approximately 11,200 contractions per session. This level of muscle activation far exceeds what voluntary Kegel exercises can achieve, rebuilding the muscle strength and coordination that reduces or eliminates urinary leakage.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How many Emsella sessions do I need?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The standard protocol is <strong>6 sessions over 3 weeks</strong> — two sessions per week. Most patients begin noticing improvement around sessions 3-4. Results continue to improve for 4-6 weeks after completing the full series as muscles continue to strengthen.</p>
                    <p>Some patients with more severe incontinence benefit from additional sessions. Maintenance sessions every 6-12 months help preserve long-term results.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What does an Emsella session feel like?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most patients describe a series of tingling, pulsing sensations or a feeling of intense muscle tightening in the pelvic region. It's not painful — more unusual than uncomfortable. You may feel involuntary muscle contractions and some vibration. Intensity can typically be adjusted to your comfort level.</p>
                    <p>You remain fully clothed throughout, seated in a chair that resembles a standard office chair. Most people read, use their phone, or simply relax during the session.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What results can I expect, and when?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most patients notice a meaningful reduction in leakage frequency and volume after sessions 3-4. The full benefit typically peaks <strong>4-6 weeks after completing all 6 sessions</strong>, as muscles continue strengthening after treatment ends.</p>
                    <p>Clinical studies show 95% of patients report significant improvement in quality of life. For many patients, incontinence resolves completely; others see a major reduction that allows them to return to activities they'd been avoiding — exercise, travel, social outings.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How long do Emsella results last?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Results typically last <strong>6-12 months</strong> after completing the initial 6-session series. Most patients choose periodic maintenance sessions — typically 1-2 sessions every 6-12 months — to preserve their results.</p>
                    <p>Factors like additional pregnancies, significant weight gain, or hormonal changes (such as menopause) can affect how long results hold.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Is Emsella covered by insurance?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Emsella is not currently covered by Medicare or most private insurance plans — it's classified as an elective treatment. Many patients pay with <strong>HSA or FSA funds</strong>, which are typically accepted.</p>
                    <p>At Bay View Chiropractic in Milwaukee, the full 6-session package is $1,800.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Who is a good candidate for Emsella?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Emsella works well for most adults experiencing urinary incontinence. Ideal candidates include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Women with stress incontinence (leaking with coughing, sneezing, or exercise)</li>
                        <li>Women with urge or mixed incontinence</li>
                        <li>Postpartum women whose incontinence hasn't fully resolved</li>
                        <li>Men experiencing incontinence after prostate surgery</li>
                        <li>Menopausal women dealing with bladder changes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Emsella is <strong>not appropriate</strong> for patients with pacemakers, metal implants in the treatment area, or active urinary tract infections.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Can men use Emsella?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes. Emsella is effective for men, particularly those experiencing incontinence following prostate surgery (radical prostatectomy). Studies show 70-80% of men regain complete or near-complete continence within 6 months of surgery — and Emsella can accelerate and improve this recovery.</p>
                    <p>Men sit on the chair fully clothed, just as women do.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Are there any side effects or risks?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Emsella is non-invasive with a very favorable safety profile. The most common side effect is <strong>temporary muscle soreness</strong>, similar to what you'd feel after an intense workout — typically resolving within 24-48 hours.</p>
                    <p>Some patients notice slightly increased urinary frequency for the first day or two as muscles adapt. There is no downtime; you return to normal activities immediately after each session.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How is Emsella different from pelvic floor physical therapy?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Both target the pelvic floor — but through different mechanisms:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pelvic floor PT</strong> uses biofeedback, manual therapy, and guided exercises with a trained therapist. Effective, but requires 6-12 weekly appointments, daily homework (20-45 min/day), and significant financial commitment — with limited insurance coverage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emsella</strong> requires no active participation. You sit for 28 minutes while the technology does the work, producing 11,200 contractions per session versus the few hundred achievable through manual exercise.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Many patients choose Emsella because it's faster, requires less time commitment, and produces results for those who can't perform voluntary exercises correctly. Both approaches can also be combined for severe cases.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>What are the different types of urinary incontinence?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The main types are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stress incontinence</strong> — leaking with physical pressure: coughing, sneezing, laughing, jumping, or lifting. Caused by a weakened pelvic floor or sphincter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Urge incontinence</strong> — a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by leaking. Caused by an overactive bladder that contracts involuntarily.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mixed incontinence</strong> — a combination of both stress and urge. Very common, especially in women.</li>
                        <li><strong>Overflow incontinence</strong> — inability to fully empty the bladder, causing constant dribbling. More common in men.</li>
                        <li><strong>Functional incontinence</strong> — physical or cognitive impairments that prevent reaching the bathroom in time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What's the difference between stress and urge incontinence?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p><strong>Stress incontinence</strong> leaks happen in response to physical pressure — coughing, sneezing, laughing, jumping, or lifting. The problem is structural: the pelvic floor or sphincter can't resist sudden pressure spikes. Treatment focuses on strengthening those muscles.</p>
                    <p><strong>Urge incontinence</strong> involves a sudden, overwhelming urge to urinate that's hard to suppress, sometimes resulting in leakage before reaching the bathroom. The problem is bladder behavior: the bladder signals urgency when it's not actually full. Treatment focuses on calming the overactive bladder reflex.</p>
                    <p>Many people have both simultaneously — this is called <strong>mixed incontinence</strong>. Emsella addresses both types, which makes it particularly useful for mixed presentations.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Is incontinence a normal part of aging?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Incontinence becomes more common with age, but it's <strong>not inevitable or untreatable</strong>. The changes that come with aging — reduced muscle mass, hormonal shifts, prostate changes in men — increase risk. But "common" doesn't mean "permanent."</p>
                    <p>Most people of any age can achieve significant improvement with appropriate treatment. There is no age limit for Emsella or pelvic floor therapy — patients in their 70s and beyond see meaningful results.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Why aren't my Kegels working?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Several reasons Kegels fail:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Incorrect technique</strong> — Studies show up to 70% of people contract the wrong muscles, bear down instead of lifting up, or hold their breath. Without feedback, it's hard to know if you're doing them right.</li>
                        <li><strong>Insufficient volume</strong> — Effective Kegels require 100-200 correct contractions daily for 3-6 months. Most people do far fewer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wrong type of incontinence</strong> — Kegels target stress incontinence. They provide little benefit for urge incontinence or overactive bladder.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hormonal barriers</strong> — Pelvic floor muscles respond less robustly to voluntary exercise when estrogen is low (perimenopause, menopause).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If Kegels haven't worked, it typically means you need a more powerful strengthening method — not just more Kegels.</p>

                <summary>Can urinary incontinence be cured?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>For many people, yes — the outcome depends on type and cause:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stress incontinence</strong> — often significantly improved or fully resolved with pelvic floor strengthening (Emsella, pelvic floor PT)</li>
                        <li><strong>Postpartum incontinence</strong> — frequently resolves completely, especially with treatment</li>
                        <li><strong>Post-prostatectomy</strong> — most men (70-80%) regain near-complete continence with time and therapy</li>
                        <li><strong>Menopausal incontinence</strong> — very responsive to treatment, though maintenance may be needed given the permanent hormonal change</li>
                        <li><strong>Severe structural incontinence</strong> — may require surgery, but non-surgical options should always be tried first</li>

                <summary>Does menopause cause incontinence?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes. Estrogen receptors are found throughout the bladder wall, urethra, and pelvic floor muscles. When estrogen declines during perimenopause and menopause, these tissues thin, lose elasticity, and weaken — directly affecting the ability to control urination.</p>
                    <p>This causes both stress incontinence (weakened pelvic floor can't resist pressure) and urge incontinence (bladder lining becomes more sensitive). Unlike postpartum incontinence, menopausal incontinence typically <strong>does not resolve without treatment</strong> because the underlying hormonal change is permanent.</p>

                <summary>Will my incontinence go away after pregnancy on its own?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Often, yes — especially with active pelvic floor work. About 30-50% of women experience incontinence in the months following childbirth, but the majority see significant improvement within 6-12 months postpartum.</p>
                    <p>Women who do targeted therapy (Emsella or pelvic floor PT) recover faster and more completely than those who wait passively. If incontinence is still present 6 months after delivery, it's unlikely to resolve entirely on its own — treatment at that point is recommended.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most men experience some urinary leakage immediately after prostatectomy — ranging from mild to significant. The good news: <strong>70-80% regain complete or near-complete continence by 6 months</strong> after surgery, often without any treatment.</p>
                    <p>For men still experiencing significant leakage at 3-6 months, Emsella can accelerate recovery by directly strengthening the external urinary sphincter and pelvic floor — the muscles that compensate for the surgical disruption.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Your first appointment begins with a free consultation with Dr. Fritz. We'll discuss your symptoms, medical history, and what you've tried previously. This helps confirm that Emsella is the right fit and sets expectations for your results.</p>
                    <p>If you decide to proceed, the first Emsella session can often be done the same day. The session itself is 28 minutes. You can drive yourself and return to work immediately after — no downtime or preparation is needed.</p>
